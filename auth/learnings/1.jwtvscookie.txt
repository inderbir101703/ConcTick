cookie
whenever browser sends headers to user . it sends cookies with some values. and it storedin browser.
and anytime we send request to server that cookie data is send in headers 



JWT 
we take some information that is payload and payload is thrown in JWT creation algo. JWT is created with info encoded in it.
some ways to send jwt to servers.
1. send as authorization header to server
2. send as token in a nornmal post request
3. send it as a cookie



JWT issues with ssr 
in csr , first there is a html request and then  there is js loading and then after js we can write jslogic to add header and make a call.
but in ssr we need html on initialload. means server needs to send data from services. on initial hit , we need to send entire html page 
and there is no way we can write js logic before hitting the url . so the only way is http only cookies. first request need authenication info and we
can not modify it so we has to add jwt in a cookie.






Cookies                     JWT
1. transport mehanism       1. author/authen mechanism 
2. moves any kind of data   2. stores any data
between server and user
3. automatically managed    3. handled manually
by browser

4. expired aby browser. user  4. itself contain feature to expire
can still use it the data


authenication method can not just return true or false. it also needs to return what acess does user have
so a auth service must : must tell us details about user , their access , must be language independant(cookie differ from acess from language) , must not need database (if we set session in cookie , we need db at server to store and verifies cookies) , expire and invalidate itself
