to test express port directly in test cases is hard coded and cause issues if port is busy .
super set library we can use to mock http mock

so if in index app is listening on specific port we can not use 

ideal setup
index.js-> start a port on 3000
app.js-> express app listening to any port which will support both index.js and test file


to use multiple databases at a time , we need mongodb-memory-server
for testing --save-dev dependencies , whenver we run our docker file these uneccesary dependecies will not be there
