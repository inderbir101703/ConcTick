The toJSON() method in JavaScript is used to control how objects are converted into JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) strings.
 When you call JSON.stringify() on an object, JavaScript will look for a toJSON() method in that object to customize the JSON representation.
  If it exists, JavaScript will use the return value of toJSON() as the JSON data instead of the object itself.
